The data in PipeCAD is organized in a tree hierarchy, so tree views are provided in each module. Each node in the corresponding tree structure is an object, and different objects have different properties. PipeCAD integrates the Python development language, and can use Python to develop customized functions. The Model Editor of the design module can easily adjust the position of the model, and the distance and coordinate information can be easily queried through the query function in the design module. 

Common functions are listed on the general operation panel of PipeCAD, mainly showing/hiding the tree view Explorer, showing/hiding the property list Properties, and showing/hiding the Python command window Console.
