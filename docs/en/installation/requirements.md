## Hardware Requirements

PipeCAD does not have high hardware requirements. Because it is a 3D software, it has high requirements on graphics cards, preferably a discrete graphics card with supports OpenGL 3.3 and above.

|Component|Min|Recommended|
|---|---|---|
|Memory|1Gb|8Gb|
|HDD Space|1Gb|Depends from project size|
|Graphics card|Discrete graphics card, OpenGL3.3|

## Software Requirement

Windows 7, 10

Ubuntu 20.04 using Wine 

PipeCAD is developed using Visual Studio 2015, so Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2015 are required, and the library program lacking VC will report an error. The Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 download address is: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145
