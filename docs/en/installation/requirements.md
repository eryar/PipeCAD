## Hardware Requirements

PipeCAD does not have high hardware requirements. Because it is a 3D software, it has high requirements on graphics cards, preferably a discrete graphics card with supports OpenGL 3.3 and above.

|Component|Min|Recommended|
|---|---|---|
|Memory|1Gb|8Gb|
|HDD Space|1Gb|Depends from project size|
|Graphics card|Discrete graphics card, OpenGL3.3|

## Software Requirement

### OS Windows 
For Windows operating system PipeCAD is developed using Visual Studio 2015, so Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2015 is required, and the dynamic library program lacking Visual C++ will report an error. The Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 download address is:
